This project is a simple website that will display different recipes. 

I set up the HTML boiler plate for each recipe, used relative links to link each one to the
home page, used anchor tags to add images to the pages, and headings and lists to organize
the information. I also utilized an HTML validator to make sure I fixed any errrors in my
code that I had missed.
